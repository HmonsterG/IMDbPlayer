# IMDbPlayer 
*A chrome extension to integrate streaming TV shows and movies on 2Embed into IMDb*

This is now depricated due to 2embed being taken down for copyright infrigement. I'm currently working on another tool so hang tight <3

## Installation
You can simply install IMDbPlayer to Chrome/ Chromium based browsers by doing the following:
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Drag in the `.crx` file and click Add Extension
3. Done! Now you can go to IMDb and test it out

## Features/ Usage
IMDbPlayer is a very simple extension - it works by modifying the "Watch on" button to use 2Embed instead of other streaming platforms. e.g. Amazon Video, Netflix, etc. 

You can use this extension by simply going to IMDb and the page of a movie or TV show and clicking Watch on 2Embed. 

For TV shows, you will have to select an episode before playing, therefore the Watch on 2Embed button has been replaced for TV landing pages with a browse episodes button, you may play episodes from their respective pages. 

## What API are you using
A simple API is used from 2embed.to, it allows the use of IMDb IDs to find and play content using JW Player. 

2Embed itself sources its content by "crawling various websites and search engines to find movie streaming links" and then storing them on its own database - providing a simple, seamless experience. 

More detail can be found on their site.
